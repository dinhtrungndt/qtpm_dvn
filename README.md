📖 Overview

This project is a robust, full-stack enterprise management system integrated with an e-commerce storefront. It handles complex business logic, including product/order management, real-time analytics, secure payment processing, and multi-provider social authentication.

The admin interface is built with a highly responsive, AdminLTE-style dynamic layout to provide the best user experience for system administrators and managers.

✨ Key Features

💻 Frontend (Client & Admin)

Modular Architecture: Built using React.js and state management with Redux.

AdminLTE-style Dashboard: Complex, dynamic layouts with sidebar navigations, collapsible menus, and highly responsive UI components styled with Tailwind CSS.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Dynamically restricts UI components and routes based on user roles (e.g., Admin vs. Customer).

⚙️ Backend & Database

High-Performance API: Built with FastAPI for asynchronous, high-speed request handling.

Relational Database Design: Engineered with SQLAlchemy ORM, featuring complex schemas for users, products, shopping carts, orders, and real-time dashboard statistics.

🛡️ Security & Authentication

Strict JWT Session Management: Advanced session control detecting and preventing concurrent logins (logging in from a new device invalidates the previous session).

OAuth2 Social Login: Seamless integration with Google, Facebook, and GitHub authentication.

🔌 Integrations & Real-time

MoMo Payment Gateway: Integrated MoMo e-wallet API for secure, instant order checkouts.

WebSockets: Real-time bi-directional communication pushing instant order notifications and live statistics to the admin dashboard.

💡 System Architecture Highlight

One of the standout technical achievements of this project is the Session Management. The backend tightly controls JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and maintains a Session table. If a user logs in from a new device, the system automatically revokes the token of the previous session, returning a 401 Unauthorized - Logged in from another location error to the old device.
